Michelle Abuse Rumors: &ldquo;I Dont Fight Women&rdquo;\" title=\"K. Michelle And The In 'Love &amp; Hip Hop Atlanta' Cast Visits V-103\" width=\"142\" height=\"200\" style=\"float: left; margin: 5px;\" /><br /><br /><br /></div>\r\n<p>Memphitz revealed his relationship with the R&amp;B singer took a wrong turn when she showed jealously toward any female artist he worked with and that it&rsquo;s not the first time she has claimed to have been physically abused.&nbsp;&ldquo;She says it whenever she think she has a stage to say it,&rdquo; Memphitz scoffed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part One</strong></p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HNCnXycbags\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>When radio personality T.T. Torrez described an alleged incident where Memphitz put a pillow over K. Michelle&rsquo;s face to prevent her from screaming in a hotel room, he quickly shot back replying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my first time hearing that one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He went on to say after embarrassing him plenty of times in front of business partners, the hotel incident was actually the night he decided to end their relationship.&ldquo;That is last time you embarrass me. I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; he recalls telling the aspiring singer.&nbsp;He went on to describe&nbsp;K. Michelle going &ldquo;Tasmanian Devil&rdquo; trying to attack him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grabbed her and held her arms down from hitting my ass again and she was screaming. I covered her mouth because she was screaming so loud. All I did was restrain her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So what does new wife Toya, whom he just shared their one year anniversary with in Paris, think of all this drama?&nbsp;She knows who he really is, according to Memphitz.&nbsp;&ldquo;Different women bring out different things in men because I can&rsquo;t remember being with any girl that I argued with more than K. Michelle. She just would love to argue,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>After apologizing for his tweet declaring, &ldquo;I made you,&rdquo; he still took ownership of creating her image.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part Two</strong></p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wvtxn4pW7Dw\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She was abused before, just it wasn&rsquo;t by me. I can&rsquo;t be your muse anymore. You want to argue with me so you can write a hit? You want to try and defame my character so you can get fans? I can&rsquo;t lay down for that one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He also admitted dating another &lsquo;Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Atlanta&rsquo; cast member,&nbsp;<strong>Ariane</strong>.&nbsp;So, is there a chance that K. Michelle and Memphitz can clear the air?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not burying nothing with the devil,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I hope she gets help.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Guess not . . .</p>",
